# md5bruteforce
The md5 brute forcer is an almost completely useless tool for brute forcing md5 hashes. Visit https://tmpler.github.io/md5bruteforce/

If you have a hashed password enter the hash in the input box and click hash. The tool will then run through all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols.

The default hash is md5 and takes around 200,000 attempts to find for demonstration purposes.

Be warned, at 250 hashes/second it would take hundreds of thousands of years to brute force an 8 character password.

# Possible future features
Option for selecting possible characters and starting size

Include a rainbow table for common hashes
